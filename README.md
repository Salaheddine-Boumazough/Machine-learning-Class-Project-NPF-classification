# Machine-learning-Class-Project-NPF-classification
This project focuses on building a machine learning classifier to predict New Particle Formation (NPF) events based on atmospheric measurements. NPF occurs when small molecules in the atmosphere form larger particles, which eventually impact cloud formation, weather patterns, and urban air pollution levels.
